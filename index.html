            <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
            <p><b>Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950</b> to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[28][b][29] Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[30][31][32] which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[32][33]

                Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his father's tea shop on the Vadnagar railway station platform,[34] a description that the evidence of neighbours does not entirely corroborate.[35][36] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in theatre.[37] Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[38][39]
                
                When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[40] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.[41]
                
                In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[42][43] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his bride,[44] and left home, never divorcing her, but the marriage remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for many decades.[45] In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.[46] Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a pracharak in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.[47][48]</p>
